So basically I am an international University student doing a degree in computer science. I figured out if I keep on going
at the pace of university to become a developer and earn money, it its gonna take me quite a while.
So, wanted to learn coding on my own so that I could financially support myself through my journey of getting a degree in computer science.(Would usually have to work at someplace, so why not do work in computer science field!).
